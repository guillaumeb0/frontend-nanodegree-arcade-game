For playing the game, go to the frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game directory, right-click on index.html, then choose your favorite browser.

Rules:
You are a little boy trying desperatly to reach the water. Sadly, some very bad mannered bugs are going from the left to the right of your path to the water. You have to cross the street
without colliding bugs. While doing it, star shows up on the street. You have the possibility to collect them for making your collected star grown (the score shown on the top right of the map). Each time you'll collide with a bug, the player's position will be re-initialized and if you reach the water, you'll see a victory message appear.
